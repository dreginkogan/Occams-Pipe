# Occam's Pipe
Device for transferring particles between containers aboard the ISS. 

## Problem

Waste in ISS resulting from a large number of plastic bags being sent up.

Particles are hard to remove from bulk bags without excess spillage.

## Criteria

- Controllable amount of particles being transferred
- Has to be easily cleanable
- Could be hand/battery powered
- As easy to operate as possible


# Design

## Simplicity

Our design implements a straightforward and simple solution to a problem pestering astronauts. Our design includes a very minute number of components, which drives down its susceptibility to failure, simplifies manufacturing, and is overall easier to use.


## Ease of manufacture

All of the parts used can be 3D printed (excluding the rubber bands). The parts can be joined together using friction fits, but hot glue or super glue can be used to further secure the joints.

## Modularity

Our design was created in such a way that all of the components used are easily interchangeable. This means that if a part breaks, it can be easily replaced. This also means that it is easier for others to modify our design.

## Attachment Ports

The attachment ports are an interface between a bag and an Occam's Pipe. It consists of a 3D printed cylinder and rubber flap. When a bag isn't accessed, the flap remains shut, but as soon as you push an Occam's Pipe through, it opens.
