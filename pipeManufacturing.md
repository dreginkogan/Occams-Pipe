The main body of the device is the pipe, which can be manufactured out of a 1" PVC pipe. If that isn't available, the pipe can be instead 3D printed.

# Manufacturing

1) Find a 1" OD PVC pipe and cut it to a length of at least 53.6 mm.
2) Cut a slit 20.574 mm wide and 3.20 mm thick through the middle of the pipe. This slit should only penetrate the pipe once.
3) Use sandpaper to champfer the rims of the ends of the pipe to ~45 degrees.
